# Module 1: Introduction to Rust

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It was first released in 2010 and has been growing steadily in popularity since then. Rust is designed to provide memory safety without using garbage collection, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

## Why learn Rust?

Rust offers several compelling benefits:

1. **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system guarantees memory safety at compile time, preventing common bugs like null pointer dereferences, dangling pointers, and data races.

2. **Performance**: Rust provides low-level control without sacrificing safety, allowing for performance comparable to C and C++.

3. **Concurrency**: Rust's ownership model makes it easier to write concurrent code without data races, a common source of bugs in other languages.

4. **Modern Tooling**: Rust comes with great tools like Cargo (package manager, build system, and more), rustfmt (code formatter), and Clippy (linter).

5. **Growing Ecosystem**: A rapidly growing ecosystem of libraries (called "crates") for various purposes, including audio processing and digital signal processing.

6. **Cross-Platform**: Rust can target many platforms, from embedded systems to WebAssembly.

## Setting up the Rust Environment

To get started with Rust, you need to install the Rust toolchain. The easiest way to do this is using rustup, the Rust toolchain installer.

### Installing Rust

1. **Visit the Instal Rust page**:
   Go to the [Install Page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Follow the instructions for your operating system.

2. **Verifying the installation**:

    After installation, open a new terminal and run:

    ```bash
    rustc --version
    cargo --version
    ```

    You should see version information for both commands.

### Key Rust Tools

-   **rustc**: The Rust compiler.
-   **cargo**: Rust's package manager and build system.
-   **rustup**: The toolchain installer and version manager.

## Example Project: Welcome to Rust Synthesizers

Let's write our first Rust program! Create a file named `welcome.rs` in this directory with the following content:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Welcome to Rust Synthesizers!");
    println!("Get ready to build amazing audio tools with Rust!");

    // Display some information about audio synthesis concepts we'll explore
    println!("\nIn this tutorial, we'll learn about:");
    println!("- Digital Audio Basics");
    println!("- Waveform Generation");
    println!("- Filters and Effects");
    println!("- Creating a complete synthesizer");
}
```

To compile and run this program:

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Run: `rustc welcome.rs` to compile the program.
3. Run: `./welcome` (or `welcome.exe` on Windows) to execute it.

## What's Next?

In the next module, we'll dive deeper into Rust syntax and create a more complex program that prints a synthesizer ASCII art. We'll learn about the structure of Rust programs and how to compile and run them effectively.
